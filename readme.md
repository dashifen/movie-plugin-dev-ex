# Movies

This plugin was original developed to be used as an example of plugin development for a May meeting of the Philadelphia, PA WordPress meetup group.  The goal was to produce a fairly straightforward plugin that shows off actions, filters, custom post types, custom taxonomies, and other frequently used plugin concepts within the WordPress ecosystem.

## Installation

Simply grab the Zip file from GitHub and unzip it into the `wp-content/plugins` folder of your WordPress installation.  Since it's an example, there is no intention to add this to the official plugin repository.  And, I suspect there are more feature rich plugins to maintain data about movies there already.
